# CIFAR Experiments
This directory contains all the CIFAR experiments in the paper, where there are four pruning methods in total:  

1. [Filter Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08710)
2. [Non-structured weight-level pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626)

For each method, we give example commands for baseline training, finetuning, pruning.

We also give our implementation for [Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635).

## Implementation

Our code is based on [Rethink-Network-Pruning](https://github.com/Eric-mingjie/rethinking-network-pruning).
